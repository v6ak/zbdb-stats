# Adopted from mozilla/sbt

# This Dockerfile has one required ARG to determine which base image
# to use for the JDK to install.

# We need JDK 8, as it does not compile with JDK 11 for some unknown reason.
ARG OPENJDK_TAG=8u212

# First stage just determines SBT version. If build.properties changes without changing the SBT version, it just rebuilds the first stage without rebuilding the second stage.
FROM openjdk:${OPENJDK_TAG} AS sbt-version
COPY project/build.properties /
#RUN sed -n -e 's/^sbt\.version=//p' /build.properties > /version
# The old version has some weird dependency on Java 6, so we download a newer version which will download the old version thenâ€¦
RUN echo 1.1.1 > /version

# Second stage creates final image with the right SBT version
